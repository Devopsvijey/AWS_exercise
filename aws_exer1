Currently i am in Asia-pacific Tokyo region,

Now, i created an Instance by using Launch instance,

Os: Ubuntu, Micro T1, Instance key - mykey.pem, Security group - Default, Volume - 10GB, 

after successful starting, 

i used MobaXtreme to navigate into my Ubuntu VM.

I perform git_exercises, linux_exercises and docker_exercises _ these are the changes i have done in this ec2 VM.

Now, come to AWS console, Select the Instance,

Go to Actions, Select "Create Images"

Give name and other details and finally create Image.

In the left side Go to AMIs Under Images, see our saved Images.

Now, select the AMI ehich we want to use, Go to Action -->> Copy AMI,

In this page, Give name, Select Region which we want to transfer (I use N.Virginia) and click Copy AMI button.



Now, In top Right corner, near by our username section, Choose different region, i use N.Virginia.

Now, go to Images -->> AMIs section, check our Image copied from Previous region (Tokyo). It will takes few minutes to copy 

completely the images. Once, copy get completed, Choose the AMI which we copied and click Launch Instance Button,

This will ask Keypair and Security details, Not OS, because, it is copied from AMI images.

After successful starting of Instance here, Navigate into our VM through  MobaXtreme and see ls -l in /home/ubuntu area,

All our files which we create in that previous instance completely transferred here successfully.
